# E-Ink Theme for VSCode

This is a VSCode theme designed specifically for E-Ink displays.

> The color gray may look too light in a normal display, but believe me, try it and you will find it plays well in an E-Ink display, at least it does well in my DASUNG 13.3-inch display with Text Mode.

## Thanks
